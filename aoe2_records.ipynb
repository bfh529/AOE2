    "# At Long Last, the AOE2 W-L Records!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook displays how I have used Python code and AOE2 saved games to generate various summaries of W-L records.  Each saved game was renamed in a systematic way, and the file names are subsequently parsed and processed to produce these summaries.  File timestamps are also used here.  The raw dataset I have consists of all AOE2 (DE) saved games I have record of; therefore (for example), most of Ethan's ranked games will not be summarized here, since I simply don't have them; his \"Ranked Game\" W-L record as shown here is his W-L record in only the ranked games I have that he played in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a hypothetical example of a typical game filename, as renamed by myself after the game was initially recorded:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Boh-Gur-Chi (me-Andy-Tom) v Azt-Hin-Per-Burg (Spencer-Ethan-Jared-Ryan) - arabia, got our trash kicked in, loss.aoe2record`\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that I played in the game, with Andy and Tom as my teammates, against a team consisting of Spencer, Ethan, Jared, and Ryan.  Specifically, I played as the Bohemians (\"Boh\"), Andy as the Gurjaras (\"Gur\"), Tom as the Chinese (\"Chi\"), Spencer as the Aztecs (\"Azt\"), Ethan as the Hindustanis (\"Hin\"), Jared as the Persians (\"Per\"), and Ryan as the Burgundians (\"Burg\"), and the map we played was \"Arabia.\"  The summary of the game is the text between the map specification and the result (\"loss\").  \"Loss\" means that my team lost the game and the other team won the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Thankfully, this particular game was never actually played.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This filename and the succeeding summary was similar to what I fed Codeium (an AI coder), which proceeded to give me a base program to start with.  However, there are, of course, other nuances to consider when parsing the various kinds of games—ranked, more than two teams, games played on game night as opposed to other times, etc.—which is why an endless number of conditionals were introduced and the code got messy really fast (you will please excuse my use of sub-optimal coding practices).\n",
    "\n",
    "When quibbling about details of the W-L records you see, one thing to keep in mind is the fact that some games are marked \"no decision,\" meaning none of the teams or players won or lost; this may be due to the kind of game it was, the situation in which the game was played, or simply because I wasn't sure whether or how to assign a winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of today (5/9/25), there are a few features I'd like to include but haven't quite gotten to yet, including the ability to see W-L records for certain people as teammates or as opponents.  But there are nevertheless a bunch of things that still can be analyzed as it is; please follow along..."

    "\n",
    "One glaring weakness is that I don't employ a database management system such as Neo4j, and this weakness will only become more evident as the (living) data document continues to increase with each new game played.  As this was more of an exercise and less of an attempt to optimize, and since it doesn't take too long for the parser to run through a few hundred lines of data, I decided not to bother for the time being, so this remains a \\#TODO I eventually get to someday, hopefully."
